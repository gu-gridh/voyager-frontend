        for ocean vessels with certain environmental conditions. Given a set of parameters and departure, the Voyager tool fetches data
        on the ocean current and winds and tries to calculate routes. It can be used to specify a set of departure points and a destination
        to approximate possible courses to reach the target.`,

                            <li><b>Timestep</b>: Control the resolution of the movement of the boats - a smaller value will simulate more fined-grained
                            movements, but also take more time to calculate. Larger timesteps result in quicker simulations, but larger 'jumps' for the vessel.</li>

                    In general, smaller geographical regions require a smaller timestep, and larger geographical regions (e.g. the Atlantic Ocean), 
                    are more suitable for longer timesteps.

        text: `Ocean Voyager simulates sea routes on a global scale, during different seasons 
        and phases in history and prehistory. The tool will provide novel approaches to analysing 
        and validating ancient trade routes, migration and cultural exchange. The tool is being developed 
        in collaboration by GRIDH, the Department of Historical Studies, the Swedish Rock Art Research
	Archive at the University of Gothenburg and Ohio State University.

        Voyager utilizes experimental data on prehistoric boats with different capacity 
        (e.g. log boats, plank-built boats, bark boats, skin boats) and various modes of propulsion 
        as affected by meteorological and oceanographic patterns. 
        These patterns are based on open-source present-day data on sea currents and wind 
        collected by Copernicus (European Union's Earth Observation Programme) 
        and ECMWF (European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts). <br><br>
